# Guitar-tuner
A guitar tuner meant for guitarists using standard tuning (E B G D A E)

This project uses the p5.js library and ml5.js to detect the pitch of a sound input from the microphone and identify the closest musical note from a predefined set of notes. The program visualizes the detected frequency and the corresponding note on a canvas ♡♡

Features ♡: 
Pitch Detection: The program uses the ml5.js pitch detection model to analyze the microphone input and determine the frequency of the sound. 
Note Identification: Based on the detected frequency, it identifies the closest note from a predefined set of musical notes.

Libraries ♡: This project relies on the following libraries: p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding, used for sound input and canvas rendering. ml5.js: A machine learning library built on top of TensorFlow.js, used for pitch detection.

Setup ♡: To run this project, ensure you have the following: A web browser like chrome. p5.js web editor
